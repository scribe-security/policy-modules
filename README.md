# Policy Modules
Welcome to the Policy Modules repository! This repository contains policy modules provided by a policy provider for use in securing software supply chains.

## What is a Policy Provider?
A policy provider is an entity that provides policy modules for use in securing software supply chains. Policy modules are sets of user-configured rules that define the required compliance report. Policies may specify the minimum security standards or the required levels of compliance for different types of products or systems included in your build pipeline or your development process.

## What's Included in This Repository?
This repository contains official Rego-based policy modules provided by the policy provider. These policy modules are designed to work together with other building blocks in a continuous compliance platform to ensure the security and compliance of a software supply chain. These building blocks include evidence, attestations, environmental context, policies, and stores.
